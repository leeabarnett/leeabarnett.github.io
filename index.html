      Hello! I am an applied scientist at AWS, where automated reasoning is used to solve hard problems at scale in cloud security and authorization.
      My research interests are in SAT and SMT solving, especially proof systems, and formal verification in general.
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I received my doctorate (Doktor der technischen Wissenschaften) in 2022 from Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria. I was supervised by <a href="https://cca.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/biere/">Armin Biere</a> at the <a href="https://fmv.jku.at/index.html">Institute for Formal Models and Verification</a>.

      <p>Before that, I received my M.Sc. in computer science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and my B.Sc. from Tulane University with a double major in mathematics and linguistics.

      <br /><br />
      
    <h2>Recent Experience</h2>
    <p> From October 2021 to April 2022 I was an R&amp;D Engineer at Synopsys, Inc. in Hillsboro, Oregon.
